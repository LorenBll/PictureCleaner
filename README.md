# GalleryCleaner

**A streamlined image cleanup tool designed for efficiency and speed**

## Problem & Solution

Managing large collections of photos can be overwhelming. Traditional file management approaches force you to navigate through endless folders, right-click menus, and confirmation dialogs, making the cleanup process tedious and time-consuming.

**GalleryCleaner** solves this problem by providing a purpose-built interface optimized for rapid image review and deletion. With keyboard shortcuts, streamlined navigation, and an intuitive preview system, you can quickly skim through your image collection and remove unwanted files without the friction of traditional file managers.

### Appearance Customization

**Colors:**
- Window and card background colors
- Button colors (default, hover, disabled states)
- Delete button colors for safety distinction
- Text colors and input field styling
- Progress bar and selection colors

**Icons:**
- Navigation arrows (left/right)
- Action buttons (delete, rotate, refresh, back)
- Custom icon paths for complete visual control

**Typography:**
- Font family selection
- Font size adjustment

**Example customization:**
```json
{
    "appearance": {
        "colors": {
            "window_background_color": "#2d3748",
            "default_button_color": "#4299e1",
            "delete_button_color": "#f56565",
            "default_text_color": "#e2e8f0"
        },
        "icons": {
            "trash_icon_path": "custom/icons/delete.ico"
        }
    }
}
```

Changes take effect immediately when you restart the application. If any configuration is missing or invalid, the application automatically falls back to sensible defaults or detects your OS theme preferences.
